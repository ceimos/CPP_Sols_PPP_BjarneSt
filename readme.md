# My Solutions to "Programming Principle and Practice with C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup"
#### *Bjarne Stroustrup is not envolved in this reposiory.*
---

## Purpose -
I created this repository to learn together with other people on the internet.
We can compare each other's solutions.
Feel free to analyze and discuss my code.

*This Repo is active while I am using this book to learn C++*

## About *"std_lib_facilities.h"*
This contains necessary headers for us to complete the beginning dozen chapters.
Bjarne Stroustrup has not bothered us with it. (That's great, i guess, prevents information overload.)
Read More About it in Appendix C.3.2,Chapter 2.2 and Drill of chapter 2

## How to use *"std_lib_facilities.h"*
- Keep it in the folder with your source code.
- put this in your code -
```c++
#include ".\std_lib_facilities.h"
```
- The ".\\" tells the computer that it exists in the current working directory.
